                    <li>Strong seasonality is evident across nearly all categories. January shows the highest peak for most categories. December shows the second highest peak. Mid-year (May-September) generally shows lower review volumes</li>
                    <li>The categories form distinct tiers by review volume. Top tier (10,000-17,000 reviews): Gift Cards, Arts/Crafts & Sewing, and All Electronics. Middle tier (5,000-10,000 reviews): Automotive, Handmade, Amazon Home, and several others. Lower tier (under 5,000 reviews): Many niche/specialized categories</li>
                    <li>Gift Cards shows the most dramatic seasonal variation, with a very pronounced January peak around 17,000 reviews and December spike to about 12,500 reviews.</li>
                    <li>Most categories follow a similar pattern of high winter activity, dropping in February, relatively stable through summer, and rising again from October through December.</li>
                    <li>The consistency of patterns across categories suggests universal consumer behavior trends related to holiday shopping seasons, with post-holiday reviews in January and pre-holiday purchasing in December.</li>
