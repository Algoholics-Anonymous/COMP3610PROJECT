They are very strong and resist breaking than ones I have used with wood around the actual pigment. I used the 40% coupon on them and I am so pleased with them, but I do wish they had a bigger set than just the 24 set. If you have a chance to purchase these, I would say do so but use a coupon with it at Micheals. You will not be disappointed. I use it for when I'm coloring in my Adult coloring book.

If you have a chance to purchase these, I would say do so but use a coupon with it at Micheals. You will not be disappointed. I use it for when I'm coloring in my Adult coloring book.

         "[\"Want An Easy Way To Keep Your Dog Happy And Healthy In Less Than 10 Minutes A Day. In addition to obesity and health concerns, many experts say that lack of exercise is a leading cause of hyperactive and destructive behavior in dogs. As the owner of two beloved Pit Bull dogs, I'm always looking for ways to keep them well exercised. My busy schedule doesn't allow for the long walks recommended by professional dog behaviorists. I read about something called a flirt pole and thought it would be worth trying out. It works by converting the natural prey drive instinct in dogs into exercise as they attempt to catch the lure by sprinting, changing direction and jumping. So I bought one of the fiberglass rod flirt poles that are made in China. The good news is the dogs went crazy chasing the lure. The bad news is it lasted one day. One chomp on the tip of the rod and the fiberglass broke and splintered in my dog's mouth. I was angry and decided to design my own. My new and improved Flirt Pole V2 is made in the USA using components tested for durability, strength, safety and light weight. The only toy on the market that uses bungee cord to prevent; whiplash ; when lure is caught Easily change lures without the use of fasteners that can injure your dog's mouth Lightweight. The Flirt Pole with the included lure weighs less than one pound Soft, non-slip grip and wrist strap for easy handling Be sure to check out videos on the Squishy Face Studio website to see the Flirt Pole V2 in action.

Unlike our competitors, we offer only premium, fresh, brown, Grade-A Elk antlers sourced from the USA. We guarantee your pets will love our antlers. The perfect bully stick! <br> <br> <b>Grade-A Elk Antlers Represent Only 10-15% of all Elk Antler Shed Each Year</b> <br> We do not sell weathered light colored antlers that have been robbed of their nutrients. Our premium quality elk antlers are the longest lasting elk antlers you can buy. <br> <br> <b>Don't be Fooled by Cheaply Priced Antlers</b> <br>Our competitors sell Grade-B, Grade-C and even Grade-D elk antlers, which explains why they are priced so cheap (this includes those big name brands sold online and in pet stores). Lower grade antlers can be recognized by their lighter color(compare us!). Lighter colored antlers indicate that they have been weathered, dried out and bleached by the sun, robbing them of their beneficial nutrients. These lighter colored antlers are often very brittle and can break or even splinter, causing injury to your pet. Because our competitor's antlers have spent much time in the elements, they typically lack the nutrients that people look for when purchasing elk antlers for their pets. <br> <br> <b>Heartland Antlers Wants the Best for Your Pet</b> <br>Each and every one of our elk dog antlers are hand selected to ensure your pet gets only the very best available. All of our antlers come to you in a stay-fresh, resealing pouch to keep it clean and ready when not being chewed. Our premium, Grade-A elk antlers for dogs are sourced only from wild elk.

Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card. Then follow the recommendations on the card if action is required. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium. API Aquarium Treatment Supplies are designed to work in conjunction with each other to provide best results to control algae, promote healthy bacterial growth and help control and cure fish diseases and conditions such as ich and fin rot. They work to provide a safe, hospitable environment for fish such as tropical community fish, cichlids, goldfish and more. With API, you can spend more time admiring your fish, and less time scrubbing your tank. Make sure to use all products as directed in order to ensure the best results.']",

         "['Most water problems are invisible to the eye. Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card. Then follow the recommendations on the card if action is required. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium. API Aquarium Treatment Supplies are designed to work in conjunction with each other to provide best results to control algae, promote healthy bacterial growth and help control and cure fish diseases and conditions such as ich and fin rot. They work to provide a safe, hospitable environment for fish such as tropical community fish, cichlids, goldfish and more. With API, you can spend more time admiring your fish, and less time scrubbing your tank. Make sure to use all products as directed in order to ensure the best results.']",
